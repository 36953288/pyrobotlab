Additional static object libraries required for dl4j to run on the Raspberry Pi

place the following Raspberry Pi arm static object files in the mrl /libraries/native/ directory

cross compiled for the Raspberry Pi Arm processor from the nd4j and dl4j github source (0.8.1 snapshot): 
libjnind4jcpu.so
libnd4jcpu.so

openblas javacpp presets:
http://search.maven.org/remotecontent?filepath=org/bytedeco/javacpp-presets/openblas/0.2.19-1.3/openblas-0.2.19-1.3-linux-armhf.jar
libgcc_s.so.1
libgfortran.so.3
libjniopenblas.so
libopenblas.so.0

taken from the Raspberry Pi Ubuntu Mate build against which the nd4j static objects were cross compiled:
libgomp.so.1


remove libgomp.so from the mrl /libraries/jar/opencv-linux-armhf.jar as this causes a conflict with 
the libgomp static library in the library/native/ directory

there is a code fix for this in the dl4j github issues thread here:
