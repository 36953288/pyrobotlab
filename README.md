Welcome to this little space on the web.  It's a cozy little space where people are knitting away.  Don't worry if you drop a stitch along the way.  That's all part of the learning process.  This is a place to share and share alike!  These scripts might work.  They might not.  At the end of the day, it's a place to share some code!  And, that's a "good thing" :)
